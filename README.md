# Gender equality 
## UniTN Computational Social Science Project - 2020/2021
This project aim to study the perception of the role of women in society, family, work and education in the context of some European countries, using data from the European Value Survey 2017.
To achieve this goal a country-based latent class analysis (LCA) will be performed on a subset of the EVS 2017 questions.
For a more effective analysis, a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed previous to the LCA.
